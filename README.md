## Problem Statement
Traffic congestion and delayed emergency response times are significant urban challenges. Traditional traffic light systems often fail to prioritize emergency vehicles, causing dangerous delays. Our project aims to solve this by developing a smart traffic light system that prioritizes emergency vehicles, ensuring timely responses and improved road safety.

## Project Objectives
- **Design and develop** a smart traffic light system that prioritizes emergency vehicles.
- **Implement RFID technology** for emergency vehicle identification and ultrasonic sensors for vehicle detection.
- **Develop an intelligent algorithm** to control traffic lights and prioritize emergency vehicles.
- **Test and evaluate** the system's performance in a simulated environment.

## Project Significance
- **Reduced Traffic Congestion:** By adjusting signal timing to match real-time traffic patterns, the system minimizes traffic jams and enhances traffic flow.
- **Enhanced Emergency Response Times:** The system prioritizes emergency vehicles, allowing them to navigate intersections swiftly and reach critical situations on time.
- **Optimized Traffic Flow Efficiency:** The intelligent algorithm optimizes signal timing, reducing overall travel times and improving transportation network efficiency.

## Expected Outcomes
- A functional prototype of a density- and priority-based traffic light system.
- Quantitative data showcasing the system's effectiveness in reducing congestion, improving emergency response times, and optimizing traffic flow.
