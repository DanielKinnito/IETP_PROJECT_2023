## Statement of the Problem
Traffic congestion and delayed emergency response times pose significant challenges to urban safety and well-being. Traditional traffic light systems often fail to prioritize emergency vehicles, leading to delays that can have life-threatening consequences. This project aims to address these issues by developing a smart traffic light system that prioritizes emergency vehicles, ensuring timely arrival at the scene and improving overall road safety. 

## Objectives of the project 
•	To design and develop a smart traffic light system that effectively prioritizes emergency vehicles. 
•	To implement RFID technology for emergency vehicle identification and ultrasonic sensors for vehicle detection. 
•	To develop an intelligent algorithm to control traffic lights and prioritize emergency vehicles. 
•	To thoroughly test and evaluate the system's performance in a simulated environment.

## Significance of the project
•	Reduced Traffic Congestion: By dynamically adjusting signal timing to match real-time traffic patterns, the system effectively minimizes the occurrence of traffic jams, leading to smoother and more efficient traffic flow.
•	 Enhanced Emergency Response Times: The priority mechanism ensures that emergency vehicles can swiftly navigate through intersections, minimizing delays and enabling them to reach critical situations promptly.
•	Optimized Traffic Flow Efficiency: The intelligent algorithm optimizes signal timing to maximize traffic throughput, reducing overall travel times and improving the overall efficiency of the transportation network.

## Expected Outcomes
The successful completion of this project is expected to yield the following outcomes:
•	A functional prototype of a density- and priority-based traffic light system.
•	Quantitative data demonstrating the effectiveness of the DPTLS in reducing traffic congestion, improving emergency response times, and optimizing traffic flow efficiency.
